# shrinkage-microporosity
A simple theoretical and computational model for shrinkage-microporosity in solidification of metals. The constitutive laws employed are devleoped based on analyses of the creep response of porous materials given in (A.C.F. Cocks, Jnl Mech Phys Solids, 37, 693, 1989; and A.C.F. Cocks, Acta Met, 42, 2191, 1994). The model, taking into account basic heat transfer, utilises the Abaqus CREEP USER subroutine to produce creep, volumentric and plastic behaviour of the test material. 

For the physics of the model please read the PDF file 'Creep User Subroutine Model for Shrinkage Microporosity'.

This model was part of the theoratical groundwork for the project detailed in (L. Aucott, D. Huang, et al., Sci Rep, vol. 7, p. 40255, 2017; and L. Aucott, D. Huang, et al., Metall Mater Trans, A, 49(5), 1674-1682, 2018).
