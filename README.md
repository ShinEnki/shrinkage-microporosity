# shrinkage-microporosity
A simple theoretical and computational model for shrinkage-microporosity in solidification of metals. The constitutive laws employed are devleoped based on analyses of the creep response of porous materials given in (Cocks, A.C.F., Jnl Mech Phys Solids, 37, 693, 1989; and Cocks, A.C.F., Acta Met, 42, 2191, 1994). The model, taking into account basic heat transfer, utilises the Abaqus CREEP USER subroutine to produce creep, volumentric and plastic behaviour of the test material. 

A Trans-Varestraint test was later conducted to validate this model (Aucott, Huang et al. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A, 49(5), 1674-1682, 2018).
